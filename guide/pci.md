# PCI Compliance
PayFast is PCI DSS level 1 compliant. PCI DSS stands for Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard and is a PASA (Payment Association of South Africa) regulation in South Africa, this means any company accepting credit card payments on their website needs to comply in some way. Outsourcing your card payments to PayFast means you do not have to be concerned about the laborious process of being PCI compliant, and can rest assured in the knowledge that card information is handled securely.
