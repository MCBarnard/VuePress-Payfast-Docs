At PayFast, we are dedicated to enabling the easy and safe digital transfer of money from buyers to sellers. We also pride ourselves in remaining at the forefront of the South African ecommerce industry by taking part in all relevant gatherings of industry stakeholders.

Following the success of our involvement in last year’s largest assembly of business leaders, professionals and entrepreneurs on the African continent, PayFast is excited to announce that we will once again be sponsoring the Ecommerce Conference at [Leaderex 2019](http://www.leaderex.com/).

The one-day Ecommerce Conference will host some of the country’s leading industry experts who will share their knowledge and insights into current trends and practices relating to the South African ecommerce landscape. Included in the 2019 speaker lineup are David Torr from uCook, Ryan Bacher from NetFlorist and Paris Philippou from Edcon, as well as many other notable faces.

Whether you join us for the whole day or pick and mix the talks that are most suitable to the stage of your business, this is an event that you cannot afford to miss.
